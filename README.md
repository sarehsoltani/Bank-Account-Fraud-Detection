## Bank-Account-Fraud-Detection
Tabular Anomaly Detection

In this repository, we provide two reference implementations to comprehensively analyze this dataset and explore fraud detection in online bank account openings. In BAF-demo-1.ipynb, we will delve into a detailed description of the BAF dataset, which centers around detecting fraudulent applications in a large consumer bank, and explore machine learning-based methods for fraud detection. In BAF-demo-2.ipynb, we will further dive into deep learning-based methodologies applied to the same dataset.

# Dataset Overview
The BAF dataset focuses on detecting fraudulent online bank account opening applications in a large consumer bank. Fraudsters attempt to impersonate someone or create fictional individuals to gain access to banking services and carry out illicit activities. This dataset was accepted at NeurIPS 2022.

The dataset consists of individual applications, with each row representing an application made on an online platform. The label indicating fraud or legitimacy is stored in the "is_fraud" column, where a positive instance represents a fraudulent attempt and a negative instance represents a legitimate application. The dataset spans eight months from February to September, with varying fraud prevalence figures and distribution of applications.
