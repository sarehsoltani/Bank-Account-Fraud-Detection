# Bank-Account-Fraud-Detection
Tabular Anomaly Detection

Welcome to Bank Account Fraud (BAF) demo where we provide two reference implementations to do a comprehensive analysis of this dataset and explore fraud detection in online bank account openings. In BAF-demo-1.ipynb, we will delve into a detailed description of the BAF dataset, which centers around detecting fraudulent applications in a large consumer bank and explore machine learning-based methods for fraud detection. In BAF-demo-2.ipynb, we will further dive into deep learning-based methodologies applied to the same dataset.
